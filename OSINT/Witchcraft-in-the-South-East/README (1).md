# Witchcraft-in-the-South-East - medium 

## Description
* 
 * Somewhere far in the South East, a hero from centuries ago wrote up a manuscript. It detailed how practicioners from their era should deal with the afflicted. Some say the affliction is incurable as if a spell were cast on them. Unfortunately, this national hero would later be executed for some of his other writings. I wonder if you can help me find the name of this manuscript?

## Solution Steps
* Knowing that the hero was somewhere in the far South East (Asia) from centuries ago (100+ years) and was executed by his colonizers (the spanish), it would be revealed that this individual is Jose Rizal.
* It is also narrowed down to Jose Rizal because he was an avid writer who wrote many papers his captors have deemed him worthy of execution for.
* To find the specific paper, we need to focus on the challenge name and description. The name of the challenge gives a huge hint, "Witchcraft". The description of the challenge also outlines that the paper "detaiild how practicioners from their era should deal with the afflicted. Some say the affliction is incurable as if a spell were cast on them. (further alluding to supernatural phenomena or even in this case, witchcraft).
* By searching something along the lines of including key words like "Jose Rizal", "Witchcraft", "Manuscript", "Paper", "Writings" it would most definitely yield the flag which is "La Curacion de los Hechizados".
